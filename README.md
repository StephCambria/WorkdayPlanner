## Description
A simple application that will allow users to plan their workday on a 9 to 5 template. This project introduced me to Moment.js which, although depreciated, is used in this app to both get and render the current date, month, and time!

This is a slight redesign of a homework assignment, updated to reflect something more akin to my personal aesthetics.


## Installation

This application is deployed [here](https://stephcambria.github.io/WorkdayPlanner/).


## Usage
Local storage is used to store and render anything the user inputs into each text block. Whenever the user reloads the application, the previous task they have saved will appear in its respective time block. 

Mobile version pending!
